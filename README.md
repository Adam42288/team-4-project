# Day Off Planner

## Description

For this project by team No Days Off, we came up with the idea for active people that didn't have plans on their days off to quickly find something to do based on their location, the weather, and the date. We wanted to solve the problem of someone with the day off and had no plans to easily find fun activities in their area so that they can continue their active lifestyle. We learned how to effectively use multiple API's and work on a team independently.
